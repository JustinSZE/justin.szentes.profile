								<p> The question of how my personhood has developed constantly lingers in my mind. What I’ve concluded is that my experiences have taught me to consistently pursue academic knowledge, foster creativity, and maintain optimal physical health, all while cherishing the personal connections which are made throughout my journey. These are the virtues which guide each of my efforts.</p>

                                <p>During the first year of the Covid pandemic, I began to train for a full distance Ironman, which is a 140.6 mile triathlon. While also taking online college courses, I relentlessly trained for 14 months, averaging four hours a day. Through the completion of the Ironman, I had experienced how dedication leads to monumental accomplishment. This provided me with confidence to continue to pursue difficult endeavors, which resulted in my bicycle tours across the continent of Europe and around Iceland along with producing their accompanying films and film scores.</p>
								<p>Through these experiences, not only did I build the virtue of optimizing physical health, but I also experienced the value in personal connections. Through the Ironman, I was able to continue to stay motivated by training alongside others and was inspired by how they were business owners, doctors, and parents yet still managed to dedicate time to training and completing Ironmans. This proved that it will be possible for me to balance my future career in dentistry along with my other aspirations. Similarly, through my bicycle tours, I have connected with several people who travel by bicycle and have been hosted and fed by countless strangers despite the barrier of language. Through both experiences, what has given them value are the relationships which have been formed.</p>
                                <p>When it came to editing the films and composing the film scores of my bicycle tours, I was able to apply my creative visions. I wanted to create film and music which would complement both my personality and how I view solo travel. To do so, I analyzed several videos and songs which have inspired me in the past and I was curious as to what exactly created the feeling I had felt when first watching or listening to the inspirational pieces. This analytical curiosity didn’t just stick to my creative visions but also seeped into my academic aspirations.</p>
                                <p>While researching why people should care about dentistry, I had come across a couple speculative articles connecting periodontal disease to Alzheimer’s disease. By continuing to research the mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases, I realized it had become a sub category interest of mine since it fascinates me how something so pragmatic can destroy something so intangible as a person's identity. This interest now feeds the academic portion of my person and I hope to participate in advancing research in this area.</p>
                                <p>I see dentistry as the perfect avenue to maintain balance between my virtues. Not only is it academically specialized, but it also incorporates creative design and personal connections all while remaining physically active through the use of my hands and frequently switching between operating rooms. For these reasons, I look forward to being a practicing dentist and continuing to improve on my film and music production.</p>
