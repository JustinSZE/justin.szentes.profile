								<h2>Dentistry</h2>
								<p> I began my academic journey as a Business Management major but after taking several business related courses, I then realized that I didn’t enjoy the quantitative aspect of managing a business though I did enjoy managing a team. I then began to search for different professions and came to shadow my general dentist.
									After shadowing my general dentist for multiple months, I discovered that dentistry holds several aspects which I desire in my career. I saw how dentistry offers the opportunity to lead a practice, requires meticulous work with your hands, and differs from other health care professions as it allows for strong patient-doctor relationships to be made due to the frequency of checkups.

								<h2>Hospice</h2>
								<p>While shadowing different dental specialists, I also began volunteering as a personal music therapist for hospice patients. Since I pay the patients regular weekly visits, I am able to get to know the music that they enjoy, play it for them, and form amicable relationships with them. Through volunteering, I have had the opportunity to witness very moving instances in which a patient with severe dementia became verbal due to their recognition of the song I was playing. After witnessing such an event and feeling the joy of having improved someone else’s state by sharing my talent, I realized how much I want to continue serving others with my abilities and see a visible change. This specific instance also contributed towards my continued interest in learning about the mechanisms within neurodegenerative diseases in an attempt to further understand the inevitable degradation of the human brain.</p>
								<h2>Future Research</h2>
								<p>Currently, I am looking to complete research during the fall of 2024 where I would be permitted to explore the mechanisms within neurodegenerative diseases and possibly associate periodontal disease with its acceleration. The research would both contribute towards shedding more light on the theory of multipathology convergence leading to chronic neuronal stress while also prompt me towards being a more informed future practitioner who can better inform their patients of risks associated with poor oral health.</p>
